# PermMissingElem

![Difficulty: Easy](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

An array A consisting of N different integers is given. The array contains integers in the range [1..(N + 1)], which means that exactly one element is missing.
Your goal is to find that missing element.
Write a function:
<p style="font-family: monospace; font-size: 9pt; display: block; white-space: pre-wrap"><tt>def solution(A)</tt></p>
that, given an array A, returns the value of the missing element.
For example, given array A such that:
  A[0] = 2
  A[1] = 3
  A[2] = 1
  A[3] = 5
the function should return 4, as it is the missing element.
Write an <b><b>efficient</b></b> algorithm for the following assumptions:
<ul style="margin: 10px;padding: 0px;"><li>N is an integer within the range [<span class="number">0</span>..<span class="number">100,000</span>];</li>
<li>the elements of A are all distinct;</li>
<li>each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..(N + 1)].</li>
</ul>
